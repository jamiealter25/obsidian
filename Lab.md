#### **Experiment 1: Observation and identification of ports and interfacing of PC.**

**Objective:**
To visually identify the various external ports on a PC and understand the internal interfaces that connect components to the motherboard and system bus.

**Theory:**
A personal computer system consists of hardware components that must communicate with each other and with external peripheral devices. As described in the coursebook (Unit 3, Lesson 1), this communication happens through an I/O interface. The textbook explains that these interfaces can be serial (transmitting data one bit at a time) or parallel (transmitting data byte by byte). The physical connection points for external devices are called ports. Internally, components connect to the motherboard via slots and dedicated interfaces, which are all linked by the system bus. The system bus carries control, address, and data information between the different parts of the computer (Figure 3.2, page 63).

**Observations:**
During the lab session, we were provided with a standard desktop PC. We observed the following ports and interfaces:

**1. External Ports (on the back panel of the PC):**
*   **PS/2 Ports:** Two circular ports, typically colored green (for the mouse) and purple (for the keyboard).
*   **USB (Universal Serial Bus) Ports:** Multiple rectangular ports. These are used for a wide variety of modern peripherals like mice, keyboards, printers, pen drives, and external hard disks.
*   **VGA (Video Graphics Array) Port:** A 15-pin D-shaped blue port used to connect the monitor.
*   **Ethernet (LAN/RJ-45) Port:** A port slightly larger than a phone jack, used for connecting the computer to a network.
*   **Audio Jacks:** A set of small, circular ports, typically color-coded for microphone (pink), line-in (blue), and line-out/speakers (green).
*   **Serial Port (COM Port):** A 9-pin D-shaped male port, less common now but historically used for modems and older devices.
*   **Parallel Port (LPT Port):** A 25-pin D-shaped female port, primarily used for older printers.

**2. Internal Interfaces (inside the PC case):**
*   **RAM Slots:** Long, thin slots on the motherboard where RAM modules are installed.
*   **Expansion Slots (PCI/PCIe):** Slots on the motherboard used for adding expansion cards like graphics cards, sound cards, or network cards. This matches the description of slots providing access to the system bus in the textbook (page 61).
*   **SATA (Serial ATA) Ports:** Small, L-shaped ports on the motherboard used to connect the data cables for the hard disk and CD/DVD ROM drive.
*   **Power Connectors:** Various connectors from the Power Supply Unit (PSU) that provide electricity to the motherboard, hard disk, and other components.

**Conclusion:**
I successfully identified the key external ports used for connecting peripherals and the main internal interfaces for core components. This practical observation confirms the theoretical concepts of I/O interfacing and the modular architecture of a modern PC as discussed in the course textbook.

#### **Experiment 2: Installation and assembly of a PC.**

**Objective:**
To learn the correct sequence and procedure for assembling a personal computer from its individual components.

**Theory:**
As per Unit 3, Lesson 1 of our coursebook, a microcomputer's core is the motherboard, which holds the microprocessor unit (MPU), RAM, and provides expansion slots for other devices. The assembly process involves correctly installing these components onto the motherboard and mounting them inside a protective case, then connecting everything to a power supply. Careful handling and proper connections are essential for a functional system.

**Procedure and Observations:**
The following steps were demonstrated and practiced for assembling a PC:

1.  **Preparation:** We started by preparing the PC case, ensuring the standoffs (small brass screws) were in the correct positions to align with the screw holes on the motherboard. This prevents the motherboard from short-circuiting against the metal case.
2.  **CPU Installation:** The MPU (Processor) was carefully installed into its socket on the motherboard. The lever on the socket was lifted, the CPU was aligned using the corner markers, and the lever was locked back down. The CPU cooling fan was then mounted on top and its power cable connected to the motherboard.
3.  **RAM Installation:** The RAM modules were installed into their slots. We opened the clips at both ends of the slot, aligned the notch on the RAM stick with the key in the slot, and pressed down firmly until the clips clicked into place.
4.  **Motherboard Installation:** The motherboard was carefully placed into the case, aligning it with the standoffs and the back I/O shield. It was then secured with screws.
5.  **Drive Installation:** The Hard Disk Drive (HDD) and the CD-ROM drive were mounted into their respective drive bays in the front of the case and secured with screws.
6.  **Power Supply Unit (PSU) Installation:** The PSU was mounted at the back of the case and secured. We then connected the main 24-pin power connector and the 4/8-pin CPU power connector to the motherboard. Power connectors were also attached to the HDD and CD-ROM drive.
7.  **Data Cable Connection:** SATA data cables were connected from the hard disk and CD-ROM drive to the SATA ports on the motherboard.
8.  **Front Panel Connectors:** The small cables for the power button, reset button, USB ports, and indicator LEDs on the front of the case were connected to the corresponding pins on the motherboard. This was a delicate step requiring reference to the motherboard manual.
9.  **Final Check:** All connections were double-checked before closing the side panels of the case.

> **Picture Reference Needed**
> A series of pictures should be attached here, showing:
> 1.  The CPU and RAM installed on the motherboard.
> 2.  The motherboard mounted inside the PC case.
> 3.  The Hard Disk and Power Supply installed with cables connected.

**Conclusion:**
The assembly of a PC is a systematic process that requires attention to detail. By following the correct sequence, we were able to successfully assemble the core components of a functional computer. The process demonstrated how the various parts discussed in our course—motherboard, processor, RAM, and storage drives—fit together to form a complete system.

#### **Experiment 3: Installation, removal and study of Hard disk or CD ROM.**

**Objective:**
To learn the physical procedure for installing and removing secondary storage devices like a Hard Disk Drive (HDD) and a CD-ROM drive, and to understand their function.

**Theory:**
The course textbook (Unit 5, Lesson 2) describes Hard Disks and CD-ROMs (Unit 4, page 88) as forms of secondary storage. Unlike primary memory (RAM), secondary storage is non-volatile, meaning it retains data even when the power is turned off. Hard disks offer large storage capacity (from hundreds of megabytes to several gigabytes, as stated on page 111) and are essential for storing the operating system and user files. CD-ROMs are optical disks used for software distribution and data storage.

**Procedure and Observations:**

**Installation of a Hard Disk Drive (HDD):**

1.  **Safety First:** The PC was unplugged from the main power source.
2.  **Open Case:** The side panel of the PC case was removed to access the internal components.
3.  **Mounting the Drive:** We identified an empty 3.5-inch drive bay. The HDD was slid into the bay and secured on both sides with four screws to prevent vibration.
4.  **Connecting the Data Cable:** One end of a SATA data cable was connected to the port on the back of the HDD, and the other end was connected to an available SATA port on the motherboard.
5.  **Connecting the Power Cable:** A SATA power connector from the Power Supply Unit was connected to the power port on the HDD.
6.  **Closing Up:** The side panel was put back on the case.

**Removal of a Hard Disk Drive:**
The removal process is the reverse of the installation:
1.  Power down and unplug the PC.
2.  Open the case.
3.  Disconnect the power and data cables from the back of the HDD.
4.  Unscrew the four mounting screws holding the drive in the bay.
5.  Carefully slide the HDD out of the drive bay.

**Study of the CD-ROM Drive:**
The installation and removal process for the CD-ROM drive was observed to be nearly identical, except that it uses a larger 5.25-inch drive bay located at the front of the case. We noted that both devices are crucial parts of the computer's memory organization, serving as long-term storage.

> **Picture Reference Needed**
> A picture showing the HDD mounted in its drive bay with the SATA data and power cables connected should be attached here.

**Conclusion:**
The installation and removal of secondary storage devices like HDDs and CD-ROMs is a straightforward mechanical process. It involves physically securing the drive in a bay and making two critical connections: a data cable to the motherboard and a power cable to the PSU. This lab provided practical experience in handling these essential hardware components.
