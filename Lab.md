#### **Experiment 1: Observation and Identification of PC Ports and Interfaces**

**Objective:**
To identify and document the standard external ports and internal hardware interfaces of a modern personal computer.

**Theory:**
A personal computer's hardware components communicate with each other and with external peripherals through a dedicated I/O interface. These interfaces facilitate data transfer, which can be either serial (one bit at a time) or parallel (multiple bits simultaneously). The physical connection points for external devices are known as ports, while internal components connect to the motherboard via slots and dedicated connectors. All these interfaces are unified by the system bus, which serves as the primary pathway for control signals, memory addresses, and data.

**Observations:**
A standard desktop PC was examined to identify its primary connection points.

**1. External Ports (Rear I/O Panel):**
The following external ports were observed on the rear panel of the PC chassis:
*   **PS/2 Ports:** Distinct green and purple circular ports designated for a mouse and keyboard, respectively.
*   **USB (Universal Serial Bus) Ports:** Multiple rectangular ports for connecting a wide range of modern peripherals.
*   **VGA (Video Graphics Array) Port:** A 15-pin, blue-colored port for analog video output to a monitor.
*   **Ethernet (RJ-45) Port:** A network port for wired internet and LAN connections.
*   **Audio Jacks:** A standard set of three color-coded ports for microphone input (pink), line-in (blue), and speaker/headphone output (green).
*   **Serial (COM) Port:** A 9-pin male port for legacy device connectivity.
*   **Parallel (LPT) Port:** A 25-pin female port, historically used for connecting printers.

*   **Expansion Slots:** PCI and PCIe slots designated for installing add-on cards such as dedicated graphics cards or sound cards.
*   **SATA (Serial ATA) Ports:** Compact L-shaped ports for connecting data cables from storage devices like hard drives and optical drives.
*   **Power Connectors:** The main 24-pin ATX power connector and a supplementary CPU power connector, which receive power from the PSU.

#### **Experiment 2: Installation and Assembly of a Personal Computer**

**Objective:**
To understand and execute the correct procedure for assembling a personal computer from its constituent hardware components.

**Theory:**
The core of a microcomputer is the motherboard, which houses the central processing unit (CPU), system memory (RAM), and provides expansion slots for peripheral devices. The assembly process involves the precise installation of these components onto the motherboard, mounting the board within a chassis, and connecting all parts to a power supply unit (PSU). Proper component handling, alignment, and secure connections are critical for system stability and functionality.

**Procedure and Observations:**
The assembly of the PC followed a systematic procedure as outlined below:

1.  **Chassis Preparation:** The PC case was opened and prepared for the motherboard installation by verifying the placement of brass standoffs, which prevent electrical shorts.
2.  **CPU and Cooler Installation:** The CPU was carefully seated in its motherboard socket, aligned according to the indicator marks, and secured with the retention arm. The thermal paste was applied, and the CPU cooling assembly was mounted on top.
3.  **RAM Installation:** RAM modules were installed by aligning the notch on each module with the key in the DIMM slot and applying firm, even pressure until the side clips locked into place.
4.  **Motherboard Mounting:** The motherboard assembly was carefully lowered into the chassis, aligned with the rear I/O shield and standoffs, and secured with screws.
5.  **Drive Installation:** The Hard Disk Drive (HDD) and CD-ROM optical drive were mounted into their designated drive bays and secured.
6.  **Power Supply Installation and Cabling:** The PSU was installed in the chassis. The primary 24-pin and CPU 4/8-pin power connectors were connected to the motherboard. Power was also supplied to the HDD and optical drive.
7.  **Data Cable Connection:** SATA data cables were connected from the storage drives to the corresponding SATA ports on the motherboard.
8.  **Front Panel Wiring:** Connectors for the chassis's power switch, reset switch, status LEDs, and front-panel USB/audio ports were wired to the appropriate headers on the motherboard.
9.  **Final Inspection:** All connections were verified for security before the chassis side panels were reattached.

> ==A series of photographs should be attached, documenting:==
> ==1.  The motherboard with the CPU and RAM installed.==
> ==2.  The motherboard secured inside the PC chassis.==
> ==3.  The final assembly showing connected storage drives and the PSU.==

**Conclusion:**
The assembly of a PC is a methodical process demanding precision and careful execution. Following the established sequence ensures that all components are installed correctly, resulting in a functional system. This exercise provided practical insight into the physical integration of the computer's core hardware.

#### **Experiment 3: Installation, Removal, and Study of Secondary Storage Devices**

**Objective:**
To master the physical installation and removal of a Hard Disk Drive (HDD) and a CD-ROM drive, and to understand their role as secondary storage.

**Theory:**
Hard Disk Drives and CD-ROM drives are forms of non-volatile secondary storage, designed to retain data when the system is powered off. The HDD is the primary medium for storing the operating system, applications, and user data, offering large capacity and fast access speeds. The CD-ROM is an optical medium, historically used for software distribution and data archiving. Both devices interface with the motherboard for data transfer and require a direct connection to the power supply.

**Procedure and Observations:**

**Hard Disk Drive (HDD) Installation:**
1.  **System Preparation:** The computer was powered down and disconnected from its power source.
2.  **Chassis Access:** The side panel of the PC case was removed.
3.  **Drive Mounting:** The HDD was slid into a vacant 3.5-inch drive bay and firmly secured with mounting screws to mitigate vibration.
4.  **Data Connection:** A SATA data cable was connected between the port on the HDD and an available SATA port on the motherboard.
5.  **Power Connection:** A SATA power cable from the PSU was connected to the corresponding power input on the HDD.
6.  **Finalization:** The case was closed, and the system was prepared for power-on.

**Hard Disk Drive (HDD) Removal:**
The removal procedure was executed in the reverse order of installation: disconnecting cables, unfastening the mounting screws, and carefully sliding the drive out of its bay.

**CD-ROM Drive Analysis:**
The installation and removal process for the 5.25-inch CD-ROM drive was observed to be functionally identical to that of the HDD. Both procedures underscore the modular nature of PC storage, allowing for straightforward upgrades and replacements.

> ==**Picture Reference Needed**==
> ==A photograph showing the installed HDD in its drive bay, with clearly visible SATA data and power connections, should be attached.==

**Conclusion:**
The physical management of secondary storage devices is a fundamental skill. The process is standardized, requiring only the mechanical securing of the drive and the connection of two essential cables. This lab provided direct, hands-on experience with these critical hardware components.
