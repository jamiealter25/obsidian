## 1. Code Blocks with Syntax Highlighting

**Description:**  
Use triple backticks followed by the language name (e.g., `python`) to enable syntax highlighting for code in Obsidian. This improves readability and structure for technical documentation.

**Example:**

```Python
def greet_person(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet_person("Afrid")
```
