1.  Write a VB program that can solve geometric problems based on Pythagorean Theorem. Suppose everybody is already familiar with the above Theorem. However, some of you might have forgotten this theorem. So, let us list the formula here. By referring to a right-angled triangle ABC, if the sides are AB, BC and AC respectively, where AC is the hypotenuse, then AB, BC and AC are connected by the formula AB² + BC² = AC². Using the above formula, calculate the third side if the length of any two sides are known.
