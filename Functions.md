## **1. What is a Function?**

A **function** is a block of code designed to do a specific task.  
You can **call** it anytime you want to run that task, instead of rewriting code.

---

## **2. Defining a Function**

Use the keyword `def` to define a function.

python

CopyEdit

`def greet():     print("Hello, Afrid!")`

Here, `greet` is a function that prints a message.

---

## **3. Calling a Function**

To run the function, just call its name with parentheses:

python

CopyEdit

`greet()`

Output:

CopyEdit

`Hello, Afrid!`

---

## **4. Function Parameters (Inputs)**

Functions can take inputs called **parameters** or **arguments**:

python

CopyEdit

`def greet(name):     print(f"Hello, {name}!")`

Call it with an argument:

python

CopyEdit

`greet("Afrid")`

Output:

CopyEdit

`Hello, Afrid!`

---

## **5. Returning Values**

Functions can send back a value using `return`:

python

CopyEdit

`def add(a, b):     return a + b`

You can store the result:

python

CopyEdit

`result = add(5, 3) print(result)`

Output:

CopyEdit

`8`

---

## **6. Why use `return`?**

- It lets you **use the result** later in your program.
    
- Without `return`, functions just do something but donâ€™t send a result back.
    

---

## **7. Example: Function with both input and output**

python

CopyEdit

`def square(num):     return num * num  print(square(4))  # Output: 16`
