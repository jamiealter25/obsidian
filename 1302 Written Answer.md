## Section A: Short Questions

### **1. What is function in MS Excel? Describe SUM and AVERAGE functions.**

A **function** is defined as a special prewritten formula that accepts a value or a set of values, performs a specific operation, and subsequently returns a resulting value. Functions can be used individually or incorporated as building blocks within larger formulas.

- **SUM function:** This function returns the total sum of its arguments. For instance, `=SUM(B5:B12)` calculates the sum of all values in cells B5 through B12.
- **AVERAGE function:** This function returns the arithmetic average of its arguments.

### **2. Define sorting and filtering in MS Access.**

- **Sorting:** When records in a Microsoft Access table are sorted, a column of information is viewed in a specific sequence, such as alphabetical, numerical, or date order. Sorting can be performed in **ascending order** (e.g., A to Z) or **descending order** (e.g., Z to A).
- **Filtering:** Filtering is the process of applying a restriction to a table view so that the user sees **only the records they specifically want to view**. Each time a filter is applied to a column, it replaces any previous filter applied to that column.

### **3. What do you know about video conferencing?**

**Video conferencing** is an advanced communication technology that serves as an alternative to computer conferencing. It involves the **electronic linking of geographically scattered people who participate at the same time** in a meeting. This technology uses tools such as facsimile devices, desktop picture phones, and electronic blackboards to enable real-time communication over wide distances. While video conferencing cannot replace the benefits of face-to-face meetings (such as reading facial expressions), it offers significant savings in time, energy, and money by eliminating the need for long-distance travel.

### **4. Write the uses of Equation Editor in MS Word.**

The **Equation Editor** in MS Word is used to **add fractions, exponents, integrals, and other mathematical elements** to a document. A primary use is that it automatically handles complex formatting tasks, such as applying superscript format, reducing the font size for exponents, formatting variables in italic, and adjusting the spacing between the different mathematical elements.

### **5. Write the steps to protect MS Word document from unauthorized accessing.**

**Note: Detailed steps for protecting an MS Word document (e.g., setting passwords for access control) are not available in the provided sources.**

### **6. Write the uses of delete and backspace keys in MS Word.**

The **DELETE** and **BACKSPACE** keys are primarily used to correct simple typing mistakes.

- The **BACKSPACE** key typically deletes the character **preceding** the insertion point.
- The **DELETE** key typically deletes the character **following** the insertion point. For deleting more than just a few characters, the most efficient method is to first select the desired text or graphic and then press either the BACKSPACE or DELETE key.

### **7. Write the features of a photocopier.**

Photocopying machines are replacing duplicators as they do not require the preparation of a master. Most photocopiers offer the following features:

- **Automatic paper feeding**.
- Provision for feeding **different sizes of paper**.
- A **copy selector** used to set a specified number of copies.
- A **copy counter**. Additionally, some models can produce copies with **reduction or enlargement**, which is useful for outputs like large computer printouts. Attachments may also be available to collate, staple, and stack copied documents, and copiers that produce color copies are in the market.

### **8. Write shorts note on Pie chart.**

**Note: A specific short note or definition of a Pie Chart is not available in the provided sources.**

### **9. How to modify list formatting in Microsoft Word?**

To modify the appearance of bulleted, numbered, or multilevel lists in MS Word:

2. From the **Format menu**, choose **Bullets and Numbering**.
3. Select the corresponding tab (Bulleted, Numbered, or Multilevel).
4. Choose the **Modify button**.
5. In the resulting dialog box, various changes can be made, such as: selecting a new bullet or number format, changing the font, selecting the alignment (Left, Centered, or Right), or adjusting the horizontal space between levels.
6. To include hanging indents, ensure the **Hanging Indent** check box is selected.

### **10. Write short note on OCR.**

**OCR** stands for **Optical Character Reader**. This is an input device used for the **direct reading and conversion of typed or handwritten characters into computer readable form**. OCR devices scan the text optically, character by character, convert the input into a machine-readable code, and then store the resulting text on the system’s storage medium. Because OCR eliminates the manual human element in data entry, it helps improve data accuracy and timeliness of output. These devices can read text at a rate up to 2,400 characters per second.

### **11. Point out the advantages of e-filing over conventional filing.**

**Electronic filing** (e-filing) is a technology designed for entering and storing documents for future retrieval. The major advantages it holds over conventional filing methods are:

1. **Reduced physical space demands**.
2. **Retrieval is more rapid, systematic, well-indexed, or orderly**.

### **12. How many types of page breaks are there in the word?**

There are **two types of page breaks** in MS Word that separate a document’s text into pages (pagination):

1. **Automatic page breaks:** These are automatically inserted by Word and appear as a loosely spaced dotted line across the text area.
2. **Manual page breaks:** These are inserted manually by the user and appear as a tightly spaced dotted line with the words "Page Break" in the center of the line.

### **13. What are the different types of alignment available in MS Word?**

Paragraph alignment dictates how text is positioned between the left and right indents. The available types of alignment are:

1. **Left alignment:** Text is aligned flush with the left indent, leaving a ragged right edge (this is the default setting).
2. **Centered alignment:** Text is centered between the left and right indents.
3. **Right alignment:** Text is aligned flush with the right indent.
4. **Justified alignment:** Text is aligned simultaneously at both the left and right indents.

### **14. Define query and SQL queries?**

A **query** is a fundamental means of accessing and displaying data from database tables. More precisely, a query is a way of extracting specific data or information from a database based on search criteria.

An **SQL query** is a type of query that is created by directly using an SQL statement. When a user creates a query through Access’s Query Design view, Access automatically constructs the equivalent SQL statements in the background. If desired, the user can view or edit this SQL statement in SQL view.

### **15. Write the purposes of find and replace.**

The **Find command** on the Edit menu is used to search for specific text, formatting (such as bold or indents), special characters, and other elements (including footnotes, graphics, and fields) within a document.

The **Replace command** is used to search for the items found by the Find command and subsequently replace them with new text or formatting.

### **16. What is the difference between function and formula in Excel?**

A **Formula** is a sequence of values, cell references, functions, or operators that calculates and produces a new value from existing values, and must always begin with an equal sign (=).

A **Function** is a specialized, prewritten formula that takes an input value or set of values (arguments), performs a predefined operation, and returns a result. Functions are highly reliable because they are predesigned and tested, and they can be used either as standalone calculations or as components within larger formulas.

### **17. How you can specify a block of data?**

When functions require a list of arguments that are located in adjacent cells, the data can be specified as a **range**. The range is specified using the format: **TOP LEFT CELL ADDRESS : BOTTOM RIGHT CELL ADDRESS**. For example, a block of data spanning from cell B3 down to D5 can be efficiently specified as **B3:D5**.

### **18. Write the steps to insert page number in MS Word.**

To insert page numbers into a Word document (which places them into the header or footer area):

1. Position the insertion point.
2. Choose **Page Numbers** from the **Insert** menu.
3. Select the desired location and alignment in the Position box and Alignment box, respectively.
4. If the default numbering format (e.g., 1, 2, 3) needs to be changed, choose the **Format** button, and select the new format from the **Number Format** box.
5. Choose **OK**.

### **19. What is facsimile transmission?**

**Facsimile transmission** is a technique used to record an electronic picture of an entire page of a document on a facsimile unit and transmit that image to another facsimile terminal at a distant location. This process typically involves establishing a network connection (often by telephone dialing) between the transmitting and receiving units. The system ensures a **precise reproduction** of the original document.

4. **Demanding for Timeliness:** OA can provide timely information to administrators, helping them take timely decisions and actions to prevent undesirable consequences.
5. **Reduction in Paper Work:** Paper-based work is costly due to the procedures involved (dictation, drafting, proofreading, revising, storage). OA offers ways to reduce paperwork through computer processing, e-mail, and teleconferencing.
6. **Improved Communication Environment:** OA provides an array of advanced communication methods—including e-mail, facsimile transmission, and teleconferencing—that overcome the drawbacks of traditional channels (like slow postal service or requiring both parties to be present for a phone call).
7. **Lower Operating Cost:** While there is a high initial capital investment, the cost of electronic office equipment is rapidly falling. Investing in OA technology helps reduce rising labor costs and improves productivity, making the operating cost per hour of work decline.

### **28. What are time-sharing systems? Point out some of the logical benefits of shared-logic system over multiple stand-alone system.**

#### **Time-Sharing Systems**

Time-sharing systems are an approach to word processing used by organizations that already have large computers installed for data processing and maintaining databases. They can add extra keyboard terminals and specialized software to the existing main computer, operating in a time-sharing mode. This is similar to a shared-logic system, except that the central processor is utilized for general data processing alongside word processing tasks.

#### **Logical Benefits of Shared-Logic Systems over Multiple Stand-Alone Systems**

A **shared-logic system** uses a central, powerful processor (usually a mini-computer) and storage unit, which is accessed by several keyboards with display screens referred to as "dumb" terminals. The benefits compared to individual **stand-alone systems** (each with its own CPU, memory, and printer) are:

1. **Economical Expansion:** Shared-logic systems are more economical because of the relatively low cost of dumb terminals. When the workload increases, an additional terminal can be added without having to duplicate the entire range of costly components (CPU, printer, storage).
2. **Increased Power and Sophistication:** The centralized processor is generally more powerful and sophisticated than the internal processing units of multiple individual stand-alone systems.
3. **Collaborative Work:** Since a shared-logic system usually uses a shared external storage unit, it allows multiple users to work simultaneously on a single document stored centrally.

### **29. Explain the advantages of spreadsheet software over pencil, paper and calculator.**

An electronic spreadsheet is superior to using a pencil, paper, and calculator due to its speed, accuracy, and integrated functionality. The key advantages are:

1. **Speed and Accuracy:** The computer performs calculations much faster and with greater accuracy, enabling the user to analyze data trends sooner than manual calculations would allow.
2. **Built-in Functions:** Electronic spreadsheets have all the basic financial, mathematical, statistical, and scientific formulas already built into the software. This pre-programmed capacity significantly enhances the user's efficiency.
3. **Automatic Recalculation:** If any data input is modified, the electronic spreadsheet automatically and almost instantly recomputes the entire worksheet. This eliminates the tedious recalculation required for complex numerical models when variables are changed manually.

### **30. Define query. List the types of query and describe any two.**

#### **Definition of Query**

A query is a fundamental database mechanism used for accessing and displaying data from tables. Specifically, a query is a means of **extracting specific data or information from one or more tables** based on designated search criteria.

#### **Types of Queries in Microsoft Access**

Access includes five main types of queries:

1. Select queries
2. Action queries
3. Parameter queries
4. Crosstab queries
5. SQL queries

#### **Description of Two Query Types**

1. **Select Queries:** This is the simplest and most common query type. It retrieves data from one or more tables and presents the result in a datasheet view. Select queries are also used to group records and calculate totals such as sums, counts, or averages.
2. **Action Queries:** These queries are designed to execute a specific modification or action upon the database. They are powerful for data management because they allow changes to be applied to many records at once. Action queries include subtypes such as Append Queries (adding records to a table), Update Queries (global changes to data in existing records), Delete Queries (deleting groups of records), and Make-Table Queries (creating a new table from existing data).

### **31. What is an indexing? How you can create single field index?**

#### **Indexing Definition**

**Indexing** in a database is used to **speed up queries** on specific fields, as well as sorting and grouping operations. Access uses indexes similarly to how a human uses a book index: it looks up the location of the data in the index to find it quickly. The primary key of a table is automatically indexed.

#### **Steps to Create a Single-Field Index**

You can use the **Indexed property** to set a single-field index for fields where searching and sorting are frequently anticipated:

1. **Open the table** in **Design View**.
2. In the upper portion of the window, **click the field** for which you wish to create the index.
3. In the lower portion of the window, locate and click in the **Indexed property box**.
4. Select one of the indexing settings: **Yes (Duplicates OK)** or **Yes (No Duplicates)**.

### **32. What is database? Discuss the steps to create a database.**

#### **Database Definition**

A **database** is defined as an **organized collection of data or information**. This organization is structured in such a manner that the data can be easily accessed, managed, updated, and retrieved. Computerized databases are highly efficient because they allow users to quickly search and reorganize data in hundreds of ways.

#### **Steps to Create a Database (Microsoft Access)**

The steps required to create a new database in Microsoft Access are:

1. Start Microsoft Access.
2. Choose **Blank Database** from the "Task Pane" that appears on the right-hand side of the screen.
3. Specify a new, descriptive file name for the database. Access databases are saved with the `.mdb` extension.

#### **Different Kinds of Videotex System**

There are two primary kinds of videotex systems:

1. **Teletext:** This involves the transmission of text over the normal television channels for subsequent display on TV sets. Viewers can request pages of information (such as weather, news, or financial details) by keying in page numbers on a hand-held keypad control unit.
2. **Viewdata:** This is a more versatile, computer-based information system. It links specialized terminals—often modified television sets or word processors—to a central computer system using standard **telephone lines**. Information is stored in the central computer and updated continuously. Viewdata supports interactive capabilities, making services like electronic banking and electronic shopping possible.

### **34. What do you understand by pagination? How many types of page breaks are there in the word?**

#### **Pagination**

**Pagination** is the process of **separating a document's text into individual pages**. The actual separations that define these pages are known as page breaks.

#### **Types of Page Breaks in MS Word**

There are two types of page breaks used in MS Word:

1. **Automatic Page Breaks:** These are inserted by Word automatically when necessary, based on the page size and margin settings. They appear as a loosely spaced dotted line across the text area. Automatic page breaks cannot be deleted.
2. **Manual Page Breaks:** These are explicitly inserted by the user into the document. They appear as a tightly spaced dotted line with the words "Page Break" in the center.

### **35. Write the steps for merging and splitting cells in MS Word.**

These procedures apply to cells within a table structure in MS Word:

#### **Steps to Merge Cells**

To combine two or more adjacent cells within the same row:

1. **Select the desired cells** that you wish to combine.
2. From the **Table menu, choose Merge Cells**.

#### **Steps to Split Cells**

To divide a selected cell into multiple new columns or rows:

1. **Select the desired cells** that you wish to divide.
2. From the **Table menu, choose Split Cells**.
3. In the **Split Cells dialog box**, select the required number of columns and rows for the new division.
4. Choose **OK**.

### **36. What is database? Explain file, Record and Field of a database with example.**

#### **Database Definition**

A **database** is an organized collection of data or information designed so that it can be easily accessed, managed, updated, and retrieved. The purpose of a database management system (DBMS) is to organize, centralize, and efficiently manage this data.

#### **Database Components**

These terms refer to the structure within a table:

1. **Database File:** This is the main physical file that represents the entire database (e.g., `student.mdb`).
2. **Field (Column):** Each column in a table is a field. A field has a unique name (e.g., `studentid` or `studentname`) and contains a single, specific category of data (e.g., only names or only IDs).
3. **Record (Row):** Each row in a table is a record. A record contains all the information pertaining to a single entity (e.g., all the data for one specific student, such as their ID, name, and phone number).

**Example:** In a table named `Employee`, the attributes `Employee id`, `Name`, and `Phone Number` are the **Fields**. A single horizontal entry, such as the row containing `001 Labib 01716115139`, constitutes one **Record**.

### **37. What are the advantages of a word processor over a standard electronic type writer?**

The advantages of a stand-alone word processor over a standard electronic typewriter include:

### **40. What are the basic aspects of e-mail system? Briefly describe.**

The basic aspects, or services, provided by an electronic mail (e-mail) system are:

1. **Composition:** This is the process of creating messages and subsequent answers. For example, when replying, the system automatically extracts the originator's address and inserts it into the reply.
2. **Transfer:** This refers to the process of automatically moving messages from the originator to the recipient without requiring the user's intervention.
3. **Reporting:** This involves notifying the originator of the status of their message (e.g., whether it was delivered, rejected, or lost).
4. **Conversion:** It may be necessary to convert the message format to ensure it is suitable for display on the recipient's specific terminal or printer.
5. **Formatting:** This pertains to the layout and appearance of the displayed message on the recipient's terminal.
6. **Decomposition:** This concerns the recipient's post-receipt actions, such as immediately discarding the message, reading and then saving it, or reading and then discarding it.

### **41. What are the advantages of automating office tasks using software like MS Office?**

The source material does not specifically isolate the advantages of automating tasks using "software like MS Office" as a distinct analytical question. However, since MS Office software (like MS Word and MS Excel) is part of the larger Office Automation (OA) system, the general advantages of OA apply.

The general advantages of Office Automation, which apply to core MS Office tasks, are:

### **43. Briefly explain the concept of text wrapping in MS Word.**

**Note: The concept of text wrapping specifically in MS Word (around objects or graphics) is not detailed in the provided sources. However, the related concept of "Wrap Text" in MS Excel is defined:**

In Excel, selecting the **Wrap Text** option allows the text content within a cell to wrap around so that all text can be fully displayed, even if the column width is narrower than the text length.

### **44. What do you know about VMS? Briefly describe.**

**VMS** stands for **Voice Mail System**. A VMS functions similarly to an electronic mail box, but instead of storing a written message, it holds a **recorded voice message**. When a caller leaves a message, the computer converts the caller's oral message into a digital signal and forwards it to the intended destination. At the receiving end, the message is stored until the receiver requests it. The receiver can then hear a computerized reproduction of the caller's voice at any convenient time. VMS helps to reduce common frustrations in telephone communication, such as dealing with busy signals, or missing a call due to the unavailability of the concerned person.

### **45. Discuss the effect of reduction of paper work on the environment.**

**Note: The provided sources discuss the goals of Office Automation, including the _reduction of paperwork_ and its positive effect on office cost and space efficiency, but they do not discuss the _effect of this reduction on the environment_.**

### **46. What is sorting? How you can sort records in Microsoft Access table.**

#### **Sorting Definition**

**Sorting** is the process of arranging a column of data in a Microsoft Access table into a specific sequence, such as alphabetical, numerical, or date order. Sorting can be performed in two ways: **ascending order** (A to Z, lowest number to highest) or **descending order** (Z to A, highest number to lowest).

#### **Steps to Sort Records in Datasheet View**

1. Start Microsoft Access and open the desired database.
2. Open the table whose data you intend to sort.
3. **Click the field** (column) that you want to use as the key for sorting the records.
4. On the **Records menu**, point to **Sort**, and then click either **Sort Ascending** or **Sort Descending**.

### **47. What are the Excel data types? Explain them briefly.**

The entry entered into any cell in an Excel spreadsheet falls into one of two fundamental data types:

1. **Constant:** This refers to data that the user types directly into a cell. A constant value can be either:
    
    - A **numeric value** (which can include currency, percentage, fraction, or scientific notation).
    - **Text** (labels used to identify or clarify data). Constant values remain static unless the user selects the cell and manually edits the value.
2. **Formula:** This is a sequence composed of values, cell references, functions, or operators that is used to perform calculations and produce a new resulting value from existing data. A formula must always begin with an equal sign (=). A key characteristic is that the calculated value of a formula will change automatically whenever the values of the source cells referenced in the formula change.
