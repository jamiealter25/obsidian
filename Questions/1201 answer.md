### **Part 1: High-Priority Topics (Recurring Questions)**

This section covers the most critical topics that appear consistently in your exams.

#### **Topic 1: The Hardware & Software Relationship**

*   **Question:** "(191, B#2) 'Hardware is no use without software and software is no use without hardware'. Explain." / (201, A#2) / (211, A#1) / (231, A#1) "Hardware is useless without software". Briefly explain.
*   **Answer:** Hardware and software are codependent. Hardware represents the physical components, but it requires instructions to perform any task. Software provides these instructions. As the text states, "Without software a computer is simply a mass of electronic components." This means the hardware (like the CPU and memory) cannot function without software (like an operating system) to manage it. Conversely, "Hardware does the actual computing, and the software drives the computer." Software is just a set of instructions; it requires hardware (like the processor to execute the instructions, memory to hold them, and storage to save them) to exist and run.
*   **Page Number(s):** 10, 118.

*   **Question:** "(221, A#1) What is the difference between system software and application software?" / (201, B#4) / (211, B#5) Define software. List the types of software and Explain with example.
*   **Answer:**
    *   **Software:** Software is defined as "a sequence of instructions which directs a computer to perform certain functions." It consists of programs that drive the computer. (Page 10).
    *   **Types & Difference:** Software is generally classified into two categories:
        1.  **System Software:** These are programs that "facilitate the use of computer by a user." They manage the computer hardware and provide general services. The most important system software is the **Operating System**. Other examples include language translators and utility programs. (Pages 10, 120).
        2.  **Application Software:** This software "consists of programs to perform specific user applications." These are the programs the user interacts with to complete a specific task. Examples include word processing programs (like MS Word), spreadsheet programs (like Excel), or a program for preparing examination results. (Pages 10, 120).
*   **Page Number(s):** 10, 118, 120.

#### **Topic 2: Computer Storage & Memory**

*   **Question:** (191, A#3) / (201, A#5) / (221, A#8) What is the use of secondary storage in a computer system?
*   **Answer:** Secondary storage is used because it is **nonvolatile**, meaning "information stored in it is not lost when power is turned off." It is also highly "cost-efficient" compared to primary memory (RAM). While RAM is faster, secondary storage is used for the permanent, long-term storage of programs and data that are not actively in use, and for backups.
*   **Page Number(s):** 108.

*   **Question:** (191, A#7) / (221, A#9) Differentiate between volatile and non-volatile memory.
*   **Answer:**
    *   **Volatile Memory:** The contents of volatile memory are "lost when power is removed." **RAM** is the primary example of volatile memory. (Page 105).
    *   **Non-Volatile Memory:** The contents of non-volatile memory are retained even when the computer is powered off. **ROM** and all forms of **Secondary Storage** (like hard disks, pen drives, and tapes) are nonvolatile. (Pages 105, 108).
*   **Page Number(s):** 105, 108.

*   **Question:** (201, B#5) / (211, B#4) / (221, B#5) Describe different primary storage of computer systems.
*   **Answer:** Primary memory (or main memory) generally refers to semiconductor chips connected to the processor. The main types are:
    1.  **ROM (Read Only Memory):** This is **nonvolatile** memory used for "storing program and data for applications" that are permanently stored, such as firmware and language interpreters supplied by the manufacturer. A user can read from ROM but cannot write to it.
    2.  **RAM (Random-Access Memory):** This is "general storage that can be read from or written into by the user." RAM is used primarily "to store user programs and data" that are actively being processed. It is generally **volatile**, meaning its contents are lost when power is removed.
    3.  **PROM (Programmable Read Only Memory):** These are blank chips that can be programmed once by a special device to permanently store information, similar to ROM.
    4.  **EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory):** These chips can be programmed but can also "be erased by exposing it to ultraviolet light" and then reprogrammed.
    5.  **EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory):** This memory is similar to EPROM except that it is erased "by applying electrical pulses" via keyboard commands, without removing the chip.
*   **Page Number(s):** 104, 105, 106.

*   **Question:** (191, B#5) Write short note on- i) cache memory; ii) pen drive. / (201, A#7) What is cache memory?
*   **Answer:**
    *   **i) Cache Memory:** The textbook lists cache memory as a component of the computer's memory system (Page 200) and includes "Data Cache (Dcache)" as an integral part of the microprocessor's internal structure, linking the Bus Interface Unit and the processor (Page 66). It functions as a high-speed temporary storage area for data and instructions exchanged between the main memory and the processor.
    *   **ii) Pen Drive:** A pen drive, also known as a **USB flash drive**, is a "small storage device shaped like a pen with built-in data storage that connects to a computer by a USB... port." Flash drives are rewritable, portable, inexpensive, and offer a long warranty, and have "completely replaced floppy drives for portability."
*   **Page Number(s):** 66, 87, 193 (also listed on page 202).

#### **Topic 3: Central Processing Unit (CPU) Components**

*   **Question:** (191, A#2) / (201, A#9) / (211, A#9) Mention/Briefly write the functions of ALU.
*   **Answer:** The ALU (Arithmetic/Logic Unit) is the "computer's calculator." Its functions are:
    1.  **Arithmetic Operations:** It "performs all arithmetic operations," which "include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division."
    2.  **Decision Making (Logical Operations):** It performs "decision making functions," which is the "ability to compare two numbers to determine, if the first number is smaller than, equal to, or greater than the second number" and then take appropriate action based on the result.
*   **Page Number(s):** 67.

*   **Question:** (231, A#4) What is a microprocessor?
*   **Answer:** "The microprocessor is an electronic device. It is the heart and brain inside every microcomputer. This tiny chip of silicon determines the speed and power of the entire computer by handling most, if not all, of the processing jobs in the machine. The microprocessor is composed of an arithmetic/logic unit and a control unit."

*   **Page Number(s):** 79.

*   **Question:** (191, A#6) / (211, A#5) What is the difference between serial and parallel interfaces?
*   **Answer:** These are two general types of interface devices:
    *   "A **serial interface** transmits data as a string of bits, one bit after the other, over a single wire."
    *   "A **parallel interface** transmits data byte by byte through a multiwire cable."
    *   Parallel interfaces are faster but more costly.
*   **Page Number(s):** 62.

*   **Question:** (201, A#3) / (211, A#3) / (231, A#7) Write the purpose(s) of scanning device.

*   **Page Number(s):** 87.

*   **Question:** (201, B#2) / (211, B#2) What is an input device? How does it differ from output device? Explain.
*   **Answer:** These two types of devices handle the two primary functions of the data processing cycle:
    *   **Input Device:** Input devices are used for the **Input** function. They "are connected to feed the computer facts or data to be processed." Examples include a keyboard or scanner.
    *   **Output Device:** Output devices are used for the **Output** function. Through these devices, "the computer feeds the processed data or information." Examples include a monitor or printer.
*   **Page Number(s):** 8–9.

*   **Question:** (221, B#2) Describe different pointing systems.
*   **Answer:** Pointing systems are devices used to "point to something on a screen" or to an item of text or graphics. Common pointing devices include:
    1.  **Light Pen:** Placed close to a monitor, a "photo sensor inside the light pen detects the scanning beam" to determine the pen's position on the screen.
    2.  **Digitizer Pad:** A pad with a pointer that "functions like a light pen... except that the pad is mounted horizontally." It is useful for converting graphics and blueprints into digital patterns.
    3.  **Mouse:** A "hand-movable device that controls the position of the cursor on a screen." It has a box with buttons and a ball (or sensor) on the bottom.
    4.  **Joystick and Trackball:** Joysticks are used (often for video games) to move the cursor. A trackball is similar but "uses a billiard-sized ball to position the cursor."
    5.  **Touchscreen:** This "detects the touch of a human finger," often using infrared light beams that "shine horizontally and vertically on the face of the screen," which are interrupted by the finger to point to an exact location.
*   **Page Number(s):** 85–86.

#### **Topic 6: Language Translators**

*   **Question:** (211, A#4) / (231, A#10) Distinguish between assembler and compiler.
*   **Answer:** Both are language translator programs, but they differ significantly:
    *   **Assembler:** Assemblers are programs "designed to translate assembly level codes into equivalent machine codes." This translation is typically a one-to-one mapping from the mnemonic source code to machine code.
    *   **Compiler:** A Compiler is a program that "translates programs written in high-level language into machine language." The key difference is that "Unlike the assembler, the compiler generates several machine language instructions for each source statement."
*   **Page Number(s):** 114.

*   **Question:** (221, A#10) What is the purpose of a compiler in programming? / (231, A#2) What is the function of a language translator?
*   **Answer:** A language translator (such as a compiler or assembler) is a type of system software. Its function is to "translate" instructions written by a programmer (the source code) "into electronic pulses that the computer can understand" (Page 135). A **Compiler** specifically "translates programs written in high-level language (like C or PASCAL) into machine language," which is the object program that the computer hardware can execute. (Page 114).
*   **Page Number(s):** 113, 114, 135.

*   **Question:** (231, A#5) List the names of six high-level languages.
*   **Answer:** Six popular high-level languages listed in the text are: 1. BASIC, 2. C, 3. FORTRAN, 4. PASCAL, 5. COBOL, and 6. C++.

*   **Page Number(s):** 56.

*   **Question:** (201, B#3) / (231, B#2) Explain the operation of the AND, NOT, NOR, XOR gate.
*   **Answer:**
    *   **AND Gate:** "An AND gate has an output 1 if all of its inputs are 1." (Page 55).
    *   **NOT Gate (Inverter):** "A NOT gate has one input and one output. It has the effect of reversing the input signal." (If input is 0, output is 1; if input is 1, output is 0). (Page 56).
    *   **NOR Gate:** "A NOR gate has the same effect as OR gate followed by a NOT gate. Hence the output will be the opposite of OR gate." (The output is 1 only when *all* inputs are 0). (Page 57).
    *   **XOR Gate:** (Exclusive OR) The output is 1 if the inputs are different (one is 1 and the other is 0), and the output is 0 if the inputs are the same (both 0 or both 1). (See Figure 5.8 Truth Table). (Page 58).
*   **Page Number(s):** 55, 56, 57, 58.

#### **Topic 8: Common Acronyms & Terminology**

### **Part 2: Unique Questions (Standalone Topics)**

This section covers specific questions that appeared once or twice, categorized by topic.

#### **Data Representation & Number Systems**

*   **Question:** (191, A#1) What do you mean by 1's complement and 2's complement method?
*   **Answer:** Complements are used by computers to store negative numbers and to perform subtraction.
    *   **One's Complement:** "the one's complement of A is obtained by subtracting each digit of A from 1." (This is the same as inverting each bit; 0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0).
    *   **Two's Complement:** "the two's complement of A is its one's complement plus 1."
*   **Page Number(s):** 43.

*   **Question:** (221, A#5) Define the term "binary system" in the context of computing.
*   **Answer:** The binary system uses the base **b=2** (whereas the decimal system uses base 10). "Any binary number is therefore a sequence of bits... Those numbers that have no fractional part... are called binary integers. The place values in the binary system are the powers of the base b=2..."
*   **Page Number(s):** 25.

*   **Question:** (191, B#3) What do you mean by data, information and code? Write representation of 469...
*   **Answer:**
    *   **Data:** "‘Data’ are the names given to basic facts such as names and numbers."
    *   **Information:** "Information is data which has been converted into a more useful form, i.e. processed facts."
    *   **Code:** "‘Codes’ are used to reduce the volume of data... This technique is called data coding."
    *   **BCD Representation of 469:** The text provides this exact example. 4 = 0100; 6 = 0110; 9 = 1001. (See Table 1.12 on page 50).
*   **Page Number(s):** 47, 51.

*   **Question:** (201, B#8) Discus different representation of numbers in computer.
*   **Answer:** Computers represent numeric data in several ways:
    1.  **Integers Representation (Fixed-point numbers):** These are numbers "that have no decimal points." A positive integer is stored in its binary form. A negative integer is stored using its **2's complement**. The computer identifies if the number is positive or negative by checking the "left most bit" (the sign bit).
    2.  **Binary Exponential Form (Floating-point numbers):** These are real numbers with embedded decimal points, stored in binary exponential form. The memory location is divided into three fields: the **Sign** bit (0 for +, 1 for -), the **Exponent** field, and the **Mantissa** field.
*   **Page Number(s):** 47–49.

*   **Question:** (211, B#3) (i) Convert the binary number (10101)2 to decimal... (ii) Write binary values for hexadecimal number AF3.
*   **Answer:**
    *   **(i) Convert (10101)2:** The binary number is the sum of those place values where the bit 1 appears.
        (1 x 2⁴) + (0 x 2³) + (1 x 2²) + (0 x 2¹) + (1 x 2⁰) = 16 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 21. (The method is explained on page 29).
    *   **(ii) Binary for AF3:** Using Table 1.4, each hexadecimal digit is replaced by its 4-bit representation.
        A = 1010; F = 1111; 3 = 0011.
        Therefore, AF3 = 1010 1111 0011.
*   **Page Number(s):** 27 (Table 1.4), 29 (Method).

*   **Question:** (221, B#3) (i) Write the bases of binary, decimal, octal and hexadecimal numbers? (ii) Write binary values for hexadecimal number AD2.
*   **Answer:**
    *   **(i) Bases:** Decimal (base 10), Binary (base 2), Octal (base 8), Hexadecimal (base 16).
    *   **(ii) Binary for AD2:** Using Table 1.4, each hexadecimal digit is replaced by its 4-bit representation.
        A = 1010; D = 1101; 2 = 0010.
        Therefore, AD2 = 1010 1101 0010.

*   **Question:** (201, B#6) Briefly explain different types of microprocessor.
*   **Answer:** Microprocessors can be classified as follows:
    1.  **CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computers):** This class is "microcode operated" (software-operated instructions inside the chip). While generally slower than RISC, its main advantage is "software compatibility" with the massive base of existing software (e.g., Intel 80X86 series processors).
    2.  **RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computers):** These CPUs "have fewer and simpler instructions programmed into ROM." Complex tasks are performed by "combining simple instructions." The main "advantage of the RISC architecture is speed."
    3.  **Special Purpose Processors:** These are used for specific applications or to enhance the main processor. Examples include **coprocessors** (like a math coprocessor to speed up numerical calculations) and **DSPs (Digital Signal Processors)**, which are "specifically designed to handle real-world analog signals."
*   **Page Number(s):** 74–76.

*   **Question:** (211, B#6) Explain different types of printer.
*   **Answer:** Printers are subdivided into two broad categories:
    1.  **Impact Printers:** In these printers, printing occurs when "a hammer striking a character form and the character form in turn striking an inked ribbon." Examples include:
        *   *Character Printers (Dot-matrix):* Print one character at a time, forming characters from a "pattern of dots formed by the ends of small wires."
        *   *Line Printers (Chain or Drum printers):* Capable of printing a whole line at a time at very high speeds.
    2.  **Nonimpact Printers:** These use laser, xerographic, or ink jet methods and are the fastest printers. Examples include:
        *   *Laser Printer:* Forms characters by "projecting a laser beam of dot-matrix pattern on a drum surface." Toner (dry ink) is attracted to the pattern and then melted onto the paper.
        *   *Ink Jet Printers:* Contain nozzles that "force ink droplets... from selected nozzles to form an image" in the manner of a matrix printer.
*   **Page Number(s):** 92–95.

*   **Question:** (221, B#1) Discuss the role of the motherboard... and explain its major components.
*   **Answer:** The role of the motherboard is to serve as the "single large circuit board" that holds and connects the primary components of the computer. Its major components are:
    1.  The **Microprocessor Unit (MPU)** (the CPU).
    2.  **ROM** (Read Only Memory).
    3.  **RAM** (Random Access Memory).
    4.  **System Bus:** A "series of parallel metal lines etched into the motherboard" that links all these elements and "carries three types of information: control, address, and data."
    5.  **Expansion Slots:** These slots provide access to the system bus, allowing I/O devices (like graphics cards) and extra RAM to be connected.
*   **Page Number(s):** 61.

*   **Question:** (221, B#4) Explain the difference between a local area network (LAN) and a wide area network (WAN)...
*   **Answer:** Computer networks are classified by scale.
    *   **LAN (Local Area Network):** A LAN is "a computer network covering a small geographic area, like a home, office, or group of buildings e.g. a school."
    *   **WAN (Wide Area Network):** A WAN covers a much larger geographic area.
    *   **The defining characteristics of LANs, in contrast to WANs,** "include their much higher data transfer rates, smaller geographic range, and lack of a need for leased telecommunication lines."
*   **Page Number(s):** 216.

#### **Software, Operating Systems & Development**

*   **Question:** (211, A#10) Distinguish between batch processing and multiprogramming.
*   **Answer:**
    *   **Batch processing:** This "involves collecting transactions together over some interval of time and then processing the whole batch." It allows "automatic job sequencing" but CPU utilization is often low because it must wait for slow I/O.
    *   **Multiprogramming:** This concept is supported by spooling. With multiprogramming, "several jobs are kept in memory at one time; the CPU is switched back and forth between them in order to increase CPU utilization" and decrease total execution time.
*   **Page Number(s):** 143, 145.

*   **Question:** (221, A#7) Define the term "file system".
*   **Answer:** A file system is a service provided by the operating system. The operating system "provides the means for... File system manipulation." This means that programs and users can "read and write files and... create and delete files by name. The operating system provides numeric file operations."

#### **Computer History & Society**

*   **Question:** (191, B#1) Outline the major landmarks of the fourth and fifth generation computer.
*   **Answer:**
    *   **Fourth Generation (1970 - ):** The major landmarks are the introduction of "monolithic storage devices" and the concept of "virtual storage" (introduced by IBM), which allowed a machine to "execute a program many times the size of the machine’s actual memory." Another landmark is the **Compact Disk (CD ROM)**.
    *   **Fifth Generation:** These computers "will be capable of reasoning, learning, making inferences." Landmarks include "massive primary-storage capabilities," "Talking machines" and **"Voice-recognition,"** **"Expert systems software,"** and the linking of huge computers in parallel.

*   **Question:** (211, B#1) Briefly describe the computer generations.
*   **Answer:**
    *   **First Gen (1942-1959):** Used vacuum tubes. Bulky, hot, unreliable. Used machine language.
    *   **Second Gen (1959-1965):** Saw the "replacement of the vacuum tubes with the transistors." Computers became reliable, compact, and free of heat problems. Used symbolic (assembly) language.
    *   **Third Gen (1965-1970):** Characterized by "integrated circuits." This increased storage and processing capabilities, allowed for processing in nanoseconds, and simultaneous processing (multitasking). Used high-level languages.
    *   **Fourth Gen (1970 - ):** Introduced "monolithic storage devices" and "virtual storage," allowing programs larger than actual memory. Led to the development of microcomputers and CD-ROMs.
    *   **Fifth Gen:** (On the horizon). Computers capable of "reasoning, learning, making inferences." Will feature massive storage, voice recognition, and expert systems.
