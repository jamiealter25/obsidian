### **Lab 2: Customizing Forms and Using Basic Controls (Textbox, Label, Button, Checkbox, Radio Button, Listbox, Treeview)**

**i. Title:** Customizing Forms and Using Basic Controls

**ii. Objectives:**
*   Customize essential form properties (Text, BackColor, etc.).
*   Implement and understand basic controls: `TextBox`, `Label`, `Button`, `CheckBox`, `RadioButton`, `ListBox`, `TreeView`.
*   Write event-driven code for control interaction.

**iii. Theory:**
Forms are application windows, customizable via properties for appearance and behavior. Controls are UI elements for user interaction and data display, each with unique properties and events. Grouping controls (e.g., `RadioButton` in `GroupBox`) manages their behavior. Event-driven programming connects user actions to code execution.

**iv. Working Diagrams:**

**Part B: Adding and Customizing Basic Controls**
1.  **Label & TextBox:** Add a `Label` ("Your Name:") and a `TextBox` (`txtUserName`).
2.  **Button:** Add a `Button` (`btnSubmit`, Text: "Submit"). Double-click and add:
    ```vb.net
    Private Sub btnSubmit_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnSubmit.Click
        If txtUserName.Text <> "" Then MsgBox("Hello, " & txtUserName.Text)
    End Sub
    ```
3.  **Check Boxes:** Add two `CheckBoxes` (`chkOption1`, `chkOption2`; Text: "Option 1", "Option 2"). Double-click `chkOption1`:
    ```vb.net
    Private Sub chkOption1_CheckedChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles chkOption1.CheckedChanged
        MsgBox("Option 1 is " & IIf(chkOption1.Checked, "Checked", "Unchecked"))
    End Sub
    ```
4.  **Radio Buttons (in GroupBox):** Add a `GroupBox` ("Color Choice"). Inside, add two `RadioButtons` (`rdoRed`, `rdoBlue`; Text: "Red", "Blue"). Double-click `rdoRed`:
    ```vb.net
    Private Sub rdoRed_CheckedChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles rdoRed.CheckedChanged
        If rdoRed.Checked Then MsgBox("Red selected.")
    End Sub
    ```
5.  **List Box:** Add a `ListBox` (`lstItems`). In Properties, add sample `Items` (e.g., Apple, Banana). Double-click:
    ```vb.net
    Private Sub lstItems_SelectedIndexChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles lstItems.SelectedIndexChanged
        If lstItems.SelectedIndex <> -1 Then MsgBox("Selected: " & lstItems.SelectedItem.ToString())
    End Sub
    ```
6.  **Tree View:** Add a `TreeView` (`trvData`). In Properties, `Nodes`, add a root node (e.g., "Root") and a few child nodes. Double-click:
    ```vb.net
    Private Sub trvData_AfterSelect(sender As Object, e As TreeViewEventArgs) Handles trvData.AfterSelect
        If e.Node IsNot Nothing Then MsgBox("Node: " & e.Node.Text)
    End Sub
    ```
7.  Save and Run (`F5`). Test all controls.

**vii. Results:**
The form was successfully customized, and various basic controls were added and configured. Each control responded to user interaction (e.g., button click, checkbox state change, item selection), demonstrating event-driven functionality through message boxes.

**viii. Discussion and Conclusion:**
This lab provided hands-on experience in building a user interface with fundamental Visual Basic controls and customizing form properties. Understanding the purpose, properties, and events of `Label`, `TextBox`, `Button`, `CheckBox`, `RadioButton`, `ListBox`, and `TreeView` is crucial for effective GUI design and interaction in Windows Forms applications.

        Dim num2 = InputBox("Enter num 2:", "Input", "0")
        If num1 <> "" AndAlso num2 <> "" Then
            Try
                Dim result = CDbl(num1) + CDbl(num2)
                MsgBox("Sum: " & result, MsgBoxStyle.Information)
            Catch ex As Exception : MsgBox("Invalid input.", MsgBoxStyle.Critical)
            End Try
        End If
    End Sub
    ```
2.  Save and Run (`F5`). Test menu, tabs, trackbar, and calculator.

**vii. Results:**
A UI was developed with a `MenuStrip` for navigation and a `TabControl` for organizing content. A `TrackBar` on the "Settings" tab provided value selection.

### **Lab 4: Use of Loop**

**i. Title:** Implementing Looping Constructs in Visual Basic

**ii. Objectives:**
*   Understand and apply `For...Next` loops for fixed iterations.
*   Implement `Do While...Loop` and `Do Until...Loop` for conditional iterations.
*   Utilize `For Each...Next` loops for collection iteration.
*   Display loop outputs using `ListBox` and `TextBox`.

**iii. Theory:**
Loops repeatedly execute code blocks, essential for repetitive tasks like processing lists or calculations.
*   `For...Next`: When the number of iterations is known.
*   `Do While...Loop` / `Do Until...Loop`: When repetition depends on a condition (checked at start or end).
*   `For Each...Next`: For iterating over items in a collection.
Loops reduce code redundancy and improve efficiency.

**iv. Working Diagrams:**
*   **Diagram 1: Form with Loop Demonstration Controls.** Show `Form1` with three `GroupBoxes`:
    *   **"For...Next"**: Button ("Run For Loop") and `ListBox` (`lstForOutput`).
    *   **"Do While"**: Button ("Run Do While") and `TextBox` (`txtDoWhileOutput`, Multiline).
    *   **"For Each"**: Button ("Run For Each") and `ListBox` (`lstForEachOutput`).
*   **Diagram 2: Flowcharts for each loop type.** (e.g., For Loop: Init -> Condition -> Body -> Increment; Do While: Condition -> Body; Do Until: Body -> Condition).

**v. Apparatus:**
*   Personal Computer (PC)
*   Microsoft Visual Studio IDE

**vi. Procedure:**

1.  Create a new "Windows Forms App" named `LoopDemo`.
2.  **For...Next Loop:**
    *   Add a `GroupBox` ("For...Next Loop"). Inside, add a `ListBox` (`lstForOutput`) and a `Button` (`btnRunFor`, Text: "Run For Loop (1-10)").
    *   Double-click `btnRunFor` and add:
        ```vb.net
        Private Sub btnRunFor_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnRunFor.Click
            lstForOutput.Items.Clear()
            For i As Integer = 1 To 10
                lstForOutput.Items.Add("Number: " & i.ToString())
            Next
        End Sub
        ```
3.  **Do While Loop:**
    *   Add a `GroupBox` ("Do While Loop"). Inside, add a `TextBox` (`txtDoWhileOutput`, `Multiline=True`) and a `Button` (`btnRunDoWhile`, Text: "Run Do While (Countdown)").
    *   Double-click `btnRunDoWhile` and add:
        ```vb.net
        Private Sub btnRunDoWhile_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnRunDoWhile.Click
            txtDoWhileOutput.Clear()
            Dim count As Integer = 5
            Do While count >= 1
                txtDoWhileOutput.AppendText("Countdown: " & count.ToString() & Environment.NewLine)
                count -= 1
            Loop
        End Sub
        ```
4.  **For Each Loop:**
    *   Add a `GroupBox` ("For Each Loop"). Inside, add a `ListBox` (`lstForEachInput`) with some `Items` (e.g., Alice, Bob), another `ListBox` (`lstForEachOutput`), and a `Button` (`btnRunForEach`, Text: "Process Names").
    *   Double-click `btnRunForEach` and add:
        ```vb.net
        Private Sub btnRunForEach_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnRunForEach.Click
            lstForEachOutput.Items.Clear()
            For Each item As String In lstForEachInput.Items
                lstForEachOutput.Items.Add("Processing: " & item)
            Next
        End Sub
        ```
5.  Save and Run (`F5`). Test each loop button.

**vii. Results:**
The `For...Next` loop displayed numbers 1-10 in a `ListBox`. The `Do While...Loop` executed a countdown from 5 in a `TextBox`. The `For Each...Next` loop iterated through a list of names, displaying each in a separate `ListBox`, demonstrating the functionality of different looping constructs.

**viii. Discussion and Conclusion:**
This lab successfully implemented and demonstrated various looping constructs in Visual Basic. Understanding `For...Next`, `Do While...Loop`, and `For Each...Next` is fundamental for performing repetitive tasks efficiently, processing collections, and writing robust programs that can handle dynamic data. Each loop type serves specific use cases, offering flexibility in controlling program flow.

### **Lab 5: Creating Report**

**i. Title:** Creating Reports in Visual Basic Applications

**ii. Objectives:**
*   To understand the importance and components of data reporting in applications.
*   To learn how to integrate a reporting tool (e.g., ReportViewer with Local Report) into a Visual Basic Windows Forms application.
*   To design a simple report layout using tabular data.
*   To bind data from a simple data source (e.g., a `DataTable`) to the report.
*   To display the generated report within the application.

**iii. Theory:**
Reports are crucial for presenting organized data to users, often for analysis, printing, or record-keeping. In Visual Basic, reporting can be achieved using various tools, such as the built-in ReportViewer control, which can display local reports (RDLC files). RDLC (Report Definition Language Client-side) files define the layout, data sources, and presentation of the report. Data is typically retrieved from databases or in-memory collections and then bound to the report. The ReportViewer control acts as a host to render and interact with the report within the application.

**iv. Working Diagrams:**
*   **Diagram 1: Form with ReportViewer Control.** Show a `Form1` covering most of the area with a `ReportViewer` control. Show its "Smart Tag" options for choosing/designing a report.
*   **Diagram 2: Report Design (RDLC) Preview.** Show a simplified visual representation of a report layout within a design surface, with column headers (e.g., "ID", "Name", "Quantity") and detail rows indicating data fields.
*   **Diagram 3: Data Flow Diagram (Conceptual).** Illustrate data moving from a data source (e.g., "Data Table") -> "Report Data Source" -> "ReportViewer Control" on the Form.

**v. Apparatus:**
*   Personal Computer (PC)
*   Microsoft Visual Studio IDE (e.g., Visual Studio 2019, 2022) with the "Microsoft RDLC Report Designer" component installed (if not default).
*   SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) or equivalent might be needed for more complex scenarios, but for this lab, in-memory data will suffice.

**vi. Procedure:**

1.  **Start a New Project:** Create a new "Windows Forms App" named `ReportDemo`.
2.  **Add ReportViewer Control:**
    *   Drag a `ReportViewer` control from the Toolbox onto `Form1`. Dock it to fill the form (`Dock` property = `Fill`).
    *   Click the `ReportViewer`'s smart tag (small arrow) and choose "Design a new report".
3.  **Design the Report (RDLC):**
    *   A new `.rdlc` file (e.g., `Report1.rdlc`) will be added, and the Report Designer will open.
    *   In the "Report Data" pane (usually on the left), right-click "Datasets" -> "Add Dataset...".
    *   Choose "Object" as the Data source type. Click "Next".
    *   In "Choose your Business Object", select `<Add Project Data Source...>`, then choose "Object". Click "Next".
    *   For the object type, we'll create a simple class first.
        *   In Solution Explorer, right-click `ReportDemo` project -> Add -> Class. Name it `Product.vb`.
        *   Add this simple class definition:
            ```vb.net
            Public Class Product
                Public Property ProductID As Integer
                Public Property ProductName As String
                Public Property Quantity As Integer
            End Class
            ```
        *   Save `Product.vb`.
    *   Go back to the "Add Dataset" wizard. Select `ReportDemo.Product` as the business object. Click "Next", then "Finish".
    *   Now, from the "Toolbox" in the Report Designer, drag a "Table" onto the report design surface.
    *   From the "Report Data" pane, drag the fields (`ProductID`, `ProductName`, `Quantity`) from your `DataSet1` (which uses the `Product` class) onto the table's detail rows. The header row will automatically populate. Resize columns as needed.
    *   Save `Report1.rdlc`.
4.  **Populate Data and Display Report:**
    *   Go back to `Form1.vb` design view.
    *   Double-click `Form1` to open its `Load` event in the code editor.
    *   Add the following code to populate a list of `Product` objects and bind them to the report:
        ```vb.net
        Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load
            ' 1. Create a list of data (our "Product" objects)
            Dim productList As New List(Of Product) From {
                New Product With {.ProductID = 101, .ProductName = "Laptop", .Quantity = 5},
                New Product With {.ProductID = 102, .ProductName = "Mouse", .Quantity = 20},
                New Product With {.ProductID = 103, .ProductName = "Keyboard", .Quantity = 15},
                New Product With {.ProductID = 104, .ProductName = "Monitor", .Quantity = 8}
            }

            ' 2. Clear any existing data sources from the report viewer
            Me.ReportViewer1.LocalReport.DataSources.Clear()

            ' 3. Create a ReportDataSource and add our list to it
            '    "DataSet1" must match the name used in the RDLC designer
            Dim rds As New Microsoft.Reporting.WinForms.ReportDataSource("DataSet1", productList)
            Me.ReportViewer1.LocalReport.DataSources.Add(rds)

            ' 4. Set the report path (ensure it points to your RDLC file)
            Me.ReportViewer1.LocalReport.ReportEmbeddedResource = "ReportDemo.Report1.rdlc" ' ProjectName.ReportFileName.rdlc

            ' 5. Refresh the report viewer to display the report
            Me.ReportViewer1.RefreshReport()
        End Sub
        ```
    *   Make sure `ReportDemo.Report1.rdlc` in the `ReportEmbeddedResource` line matches your project name and report file name.
5.  **Run and Test:** Save all, then run the application (`F5`). The form should display the `ReportViewer` with your populated report.

**vii. Results:**
A Visual Basic Windows Forms application was successfully created with a `ReportViewer` control. A simple `.rdlc` report file was designed, linking to a custom `Product` class as its data source. In-memory data representing a list of products was created and bound to the report at runtime. The `ReportViewer` control then successfully rendered and displayed the tabular report with product ID, name, and quantity details within the application window.

**viii. Discussion and Conclusion:**
This lab provided a practical introduction to creating and displaying reports in Visual Basic applications using the `ReportViewer` control and local RDLC files. We learned the fundamental steps of defining a data source, designing the report layout, populating data, and binding it to the report. This ability to generate structured, presentable data is crucial for business applications, enabling users to view, analyze, and print information effectively. This exercise highlights how VB.NET can integrate powerful reporting functionalities into desktop applications.
