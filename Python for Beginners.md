### Module 1 - Variables
- A **variable** is like a **label** or **name** that stores a value in memory.
- Think of it like a **container** that holds something you can use later.
	- #example
	- `name = "Khalid"`
	- Here, `name` is the **variable**, and `"Khalid"` is the **value** (a string) assigned to it using `=`.

### Module 2 - Data Types
- When you give a value to Python, it has a **type** â€” it helps Python understand what the value is and how to treat it.
	- #example 
	- `name = "Khalid"` --> Text                           # str  (String)
	- `age = 25` --> Whole numbers        # int (short for integer)
	- `price = 10.25`--> Decimal numbers      # float (short for floating-point number)
	- `is_active = True`-->True or False values   # bool (short for boolean)

### Module 3 - Operators
