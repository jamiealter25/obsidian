### Print

```python
print(20+5)
```
---
### Variables
- A **variable** is like a **label** or **name** that stores a value in memory
- Think of it like a **container** that holds something you can use later
```Python
age = 20        # 'age' is a variable, '20' is the value
name = "Afrid"
```
	- #example
	- `name = "Khalid"`
	- Here, `name` is the **variable**, and `"Khalid"` is the **value** (a string) assigned to it using `=`.
	- to print this run `print(name)`
	- to print this with a message run `print("Hi," + name)`
	- or `print("Hi,",name)`
	- or `print(f"Hello, {name}")`
	- The `f` before the string means it's a **formatted string**, allowing you to include the value of `name` inside the message.
